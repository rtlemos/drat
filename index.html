To function properly, R package drat requires a branch called gh-pages. Once created, you gain access to
http://rtlemos.github.io/drat/

In the folder drat/src/contrib, there's a list of available packages in this repo (PACKAGES). 
This list is updated by the author, who builds a new source package (e.g., rcvirtual_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz) and then uses drat:

drat::insertPackage("~/workspace_github/rcvirtual_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz", "~/workspace_github/drat/")
